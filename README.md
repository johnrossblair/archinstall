Just a little something to make my arch installs a bit faster. This script is very specific to my system and likings, and is not fully automated yet.

If you are looking for an automated arch installer, I would highly recommend the archinstall package that comes with the iso.
Simply, run "archinstall" while in the arch installer iso and follow the prompts.
Visit https://github.com/archlinux/archinstall for more details.
